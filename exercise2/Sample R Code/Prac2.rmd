# Introduction

The Dominick's Finer Foods dataset is a rich collection of store-level scanner data spanning over seven years and approximately 98 million observations. The focus is on utilizing various visualization techniques to harness the scope and potential of Big Data for generating meaningful research questions. The beer data from the Dominick's dataset is used here. The visualizations are categorized into elementary, intermediate, and overall-level question visualizations, each serving unique analytical purposes.

This study integrates various visual variables such as position, size, color value, texture, color hue, orientation, and shape to produce nuanced visual representations. The key aim is to go beyond mere data presentation to facilitate data exploration, inform decision-making, and improve communication. Through these visualizations, we aim to unlock insights into product pricing, profitability, and other performance metrics that can be essential for strategic planning and operational efficiency.

knitr::include_graphics("100_percent_stacked_histogram.png")
```

### Questions of interest and conclusion



**Questions**:  

1. What is the proportion of high-profit products within each Price Tier?
2. Which Price Tier has a higher percentage of low-profit or negative-profit items?
3. Is the distribution of profit similar across different Price Tiers?

**Conclusion**:  

The 100% Stacked Histogram offers an effective representation of how gross margin varies by Price Tier. It employs a straightforward design with vertical bars to communicate both the proportion and the Price Tier of each profit bin. The removal of rows with NA values assures data integrity. Utilizing the Viridis color palette enhances interpretability for those with color vision deficiencies. The visualization can be used to identify Price Tiers with a higher proportion of low-profit items, which can then be further investigated to determine the underlying causes.
